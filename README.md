Assignment Detail

I have been tasked to create a working program to demonstrate a “Vet Clinic” as a prototype.
The Vet Clinic must include the following entities:
  - Admin Staff (e.g. Receptionist; IT Nerd)
  - Medical Staff (e.g. Veterinarian; Nurse; Trainee Vet)
  - Animals (e.g. Dog, Cat, Rabbit)

When the program is executed, it must dynamically create as follows:
  - At least 10 Admin staff or various types (they cannot all be the same type). 
  There must be at least 2 different types of Admin staff.
  - At least 30 Medical staff of various types (there must be 5 Vets, and as above, the 30 cannot all be the same type). 
  There must be at least 3 different types of Medical staff.
  - At least 1000 animals. There must be at least 3 different types of Animal. 
  However, you can include additional Animal types for extra marks
